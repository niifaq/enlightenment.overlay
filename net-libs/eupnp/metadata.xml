Eupnp is a lightweight event-driven UPnP library written in C. It
implements the UPnP specification of control points, that is, Eupnp is
capable of discovering and controlling UPnP devices (printers,
routers, lights, media players, media servers and so on).

Features:

- UPnP stack implementation (discovery, description, control, eventing)
- SSDP (Simple Service Discovery Protocol) client implementation
- Multi-toolkit (works with different convenience libraries - e.g. eupnp-ecore)

Eupnp-Ecore:

Eupnp-Ecore is a convenience library that links Eupnp to Ecore,
providing Eupnp the functional requirements - e.g. webserver,
downloads, timers.

Currently it is the only convenience library available.
